# Fakémon Card Pack Simulator

This is a fun web simulator I built to showcase fake, DCGAN-generated Pokémon-like cards. I created this project to practice front-end development and learn more about interactive animations.

## Technologies
- **HTML5** – sites structure.
- **CSS3** –  styling and creating animations ->  overlays, shimmer and rainbow effect on rarities, prettiness of the website ✨✨✨
- **JavaScript** – backbone of all interactivity, generating random cards, flipping them, card rotation on hover, managing favorites logic.
- **DCGAN (Deep Convolutional GAN)** – The architechture used to generate card images (that part of the project is in the DCGAN-Pokemon-Card-Generator repo). learn more at https://github.com/OliverGrabner/DCGAN-Pokemon-Card-Generator

## What I Learned

My biggest challenge was getting the cards to rotate smoothly when hovered over. lots of trial and error with CSS and JavaScript events

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/fakemon-card-simulator.git
